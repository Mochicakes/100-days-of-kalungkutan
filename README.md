# 100-days-of-kalungkutan

**Main target:**

- I will code for at least 2 hours every day for the next 100 days.

I want to enhance my coding abilities, therefore I'm going to make it a goal for the next 100 days to write code every single day. I was motivated by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway)'s #100DaysOfCode challenge.
